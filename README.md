Project title:
Soap Glorious Soap


Repository name 
Soap-hero


Description
The Project is to build a website that encourages and empowers the audience to adopt the use of Natural soap in some form, or at least be curious enough to give it a try.
The website has 5 pages, Home, About us, Gallery, FAQ and a sign up feature called GET FREE SOAP.
I wanted to make a good case for this humble everyday household product, then showcase the benefits and difference of Natural and Organic to ordinary and mass-produced alternatives.
The concept to do a site that presents a case for natural soap is from my hobby of formulating and crafting these soaps, by hand at home; The code was heavily inspired from Love running project.

Section A: The Overall Project

Aim of project:
To educate and advocate for the adoption to any extent, of natural soaps instead of normal factory produced soap.  I have Created content that encourages the audience to be curious enough about natural soap and inform about the potential problems in regularly using soap with harmful chemicals. The main persuasion is highlighting and promoting the benefits of natural soap for the skin.
 Knowledgeable customers are more likely to trust and engage with this brand as well as become consumers of Natural soap and possibly become patrons of any future natural skincare we may add to our catalogue of product lines.

Project Objective:
To Create a beautiful, visually appealing website with all the bells and whistles that my imagination and limited knowledge of HTML and CSS can conceive.  
I am not trying to demonstrate technical prowess, as there are elements that I imagined but had to research the web for tips on how to implement them.  For instance, the changing colour of the Nav bar, one colour for active, another when clicked and a default colour for when not active.
This site is to meet the criteria as set out in the guideline, “to educate and empower the audience about the benefits of Natural soap.

Project approach:
Heavily inspired by the Love running, using this as my skeleton then change it to suit my imagined design, removing unwanted features, adding imagined features.  What is unknown, should be researched.
My reason is that if this where a work environment, and I was given a task, I would not attack it with my limitation but with what was conceived, agreed and required; I expect to research and adopt any required solution and functionality above and beyond my skill.  
I grew and increased technically as I did this.  I gained some extra time by developing my project, side by side with the Love Running exercise.

Rationale for doing this project.
I am a bona-fide artisan, skilled at soap crafts, this is a hobby, a passion, and therapy.   I paid to study for a double diploma in botanical and organic skincare and soapmaking in 2021-22 which I bagged a distinction on both (relevant certificate attached); since then, I have obsessively been formulating and crafting Botanical soaps and skincare potions.  So, when I discovered that we had to do a project, it was an easy decision to make it about Natural soaps.  I tackled this challenge as though it were “the real world”.

Section B: The Website
Website objective/ what does it do
This website highlights the benefits of Natural soap and makes a subtle argument for conversion.

Why website is useful?
Research shows a decided global shift in culture towards clean beauty.  Natural and Organic skincare products have seen a steady rise in market share globally.  This is currently a 3billion dollar industry, globally. It is a culturally trendy topic of discussion with hardly any negatives.

Intended effect on users.
Encourage to at least try Natural soap.


Target audience
Based on US stats, and using the US as a model for which other regions will more or less match.  The US Statistics and Facts Statista-states (ULTA), states that ninety percent of Gen Z and younger millennials are interested in purchasing clean beauty products in the future. By 2027, ULTA expects overall revenue to grow 12% in the global clean beauty market. Independent research is common in clean beauty.
My target audience therefore is this demographic specifically and anyone who cares about the environment, as well as those who already are consumers of bar soap albeit factory soap.
Further research shows that in the United States, 28 percent of men and 22 percent of women will mainly use organic skin care products, perhaps because nearly 40 percent of U.S. consumers believe that organic personal care and cosmetics products are healthier than conventional personal care and cosmetics products.

 

Out of scope/ Future development
Ecommerce on this website.  Offering goods and services for purchase.

How it all started/Inspiration
It started with a definite topic, Soaps.  I wanted to make a good case for this humble everyday household product, then showcase the benefits and differences of Natural and regular soaps.
The concept is inspired from my hobby of soap making, the code was heavily inspired from Love running project. 

Project Approach:
I decided not to use any of my personal soaps, even though I have 200 unique pieces, I sought free pictures on google and Shutterstock.  The reason was to maintain objectivity.  These are all referenced in the appropriate section of this readme file.
I also made it good practice to research my assumptions about Natural Soap to add great weight and credibility to what I knew about it, and what I learned formally.
	

An idea is born.  
Once I got my theme, I imagined what the website should look like, very pretty, feminine, young, conversational and lots of pictures.
I wanted enough content upfront but have an FAQ for embedding more content for hungrier audiences.
Then I conceptualized it in my mind first.  Fortunately, the Love running project was very similar, to what I imagined, so I switched loosely to that design, this gave me a headstart.

Development process
Design:
Started the process by imagining and conceiving what the final website would be, what pages would be presented, what text and information each page would convey and contain.

Assemble Content material:
Then I scouted for relevant attractive images for each page, then I wrote down the actual page content in a word document.  Read through multiple authority websites to gather relevant updated information.

Re-write content and finalize design
I managed to accumulate more content material than I could possibly use, without making the site too cluttered and tedious.  So I selected what I would use, then I rewrote the main points that I wanted to use, and matched the content of text with most suitable images.  The compilation file called Soap star notes is surrendered for your scrutiny and attached.
Finally, I designed the order of pages and the navigation bells and whistles.

Coding
Now, with a clear idea of what I wanted to do I began coding.  Firstly, from using the bits from Love Runing that I needed, amending this as I went along.
Then tweaking the code to suit my imagined design.  

Testing as I went along by viewing the output and amending it.


Coding the idea
The Love running code was the foundation for this projects code, with some tweaks here and there, mostly by design, but sometimes by accident.  For instance, my cover text did not look good on smaller screens, so I began to adjust the padding and margin by testing different values, until I found it positioned to my liking.
Image below:


Concept and idea challenges
I felt my idea was very ambitious for someone new to programming.  But compelled to do an excellent job mainly because of the topic being a particular passion of mine, I needed to bridge the gap between what I knew and where I wanted to go.  
From the 5 -day coding challenge, Code Institute said we could research things on google, as even experienced developers did so.  
So, I did.  Referenced all in the Credits section.

Coding challenges/bugs
The bugs that I did not fix are:
1.	The bugger icon for the navbar, on smaller screens is almost fallen off the screen.  It is right at the edge of the screen.  I changed margins and paddings, which improved the other nav items placement but did nothing to change the bugger icon
2.	The text on the landing page, “Reasons to love”, came out jaggered.  But I liked it and let it remain.  Having said that, I don’t know how to correct it.
3.	In the footer picture, the white grid did not work.  I decided to live with it.
4.	The bugs that were identified and fixed are listed and discussed in a separate testing.md file.


Handling errors and bugs
In addition to accepting what I could not change, I always began my de-bug effort with checking for typos, spelling mistakes, consistent naming conventions in css and html.

Sometimes, I had to copy the whole code and paste on a new page.  I think the page gets corrupt and the output looks weird.  A lot of the time, it resolved the matter.  In these cases I commented on it in the relevant “commit statement”.

Working around issues
Any issues that I could not resolve, I researched what other developers did, in google and tried out some of the prescribed code, till I got the perfect one.

Accessibility
I was deliberate to incorporate accessibility elements by:
1.	Adding alt statements to pictures.  The Lighthouse score for this is 97%.  (attached).
2.	Used a color-scheme that contrast well and within the guidelines.  My original design was yellow custard color on white background for all the H2, H3 & H4 elements.  But I changed this to improve the contrast for accessibility, to Green.
3.	I was also mindful to use meaning full headings for the content, in case a user wholly relied on a screen reader.
4.	I would have preferred not to use icons but hyperlink words for the social media links. However, I continued with icons as I noticed that a lot of website were using icons for social media, therefore it must be an accepted standard.

Measuring my output against the requirements:
•	Seamless navigation 

The navigation is by a table of contents, arranged horizontally, with a distinction between the pages offering information and the Call-to-Action Button, GET FREE SOAPS as my sign up feature.




•	Accessibility
-Used greater contrasts colours to separate normal text (black) to headings (green), special headings (purple)
-Used contrasting colours for text against white backgrounds
Light house score of 97%

•	Minimized distraction.
Where the background image is really busy and thus competes with the content, I have made it more transparent.

•	Across the board consistency 
Maintained 3 colours, White background, black text, same font, green headings.  And on 2 pages, to separate the headings, I introduced purple.
All pages have the same header with Icon and navigation, same footer of social media icons, a main page image and some text.  The landing page, is a little different as it is the wow page.


•	Smooth performance 
The lighthouse performance score is 83%

•	Frictionless conversion 
•	Clear communication 
From user testing, with my family and neighbour, they rated the site highly on clear communication. Initially used Natural, Botanical and Organic interchangeably, but amended this to only say Natural.


•	Effective visual language 
From user testing, with my family and neighbour, they rated the site highly on visual language.


•	Familiar web conventions 
These ensure that my site follows common standards, making it more user friendly
-Social media icons follow a familiar web convention.
- SEO meta data, to allow it to be found easily by search engines, this SEO scored 100% in lighthouse test.
- allows for accessibility, scored 97% in lighthouse test

Logo placement is at the highest up place up on the page in line with the convention.
- Logo always links back to homepage when clicked.
-Main navigation, as expected is along the top of the page.
- Not more than 5-7 pages used to avoid users being overwhelmed by content; in our case there are 5 separate pages.
-Content hierarchy is used.  So that the headings are clearly distinct from the rest of the paragraphs.  Sub-headings are clearly differentiated also from the main heading.
-Buttons are used for call-to-action and on hoover, color changes.
-Colours.  I used the recommended 3 colours (green, purple and yellow) and the recommended 1-3 neutrals (black, white and grey), verified by a colour checker

Screenshots below:

-The Nav bar is a familiar pattern of Home, About us, Gallery, FAQ and Sign up feature, in this case relevant for the nature of the site, and giving the audience a compelling reason and reward to part with their personal details, GET FREE SOAP.

•	A reliable, transparent interface 
From the user behaviour observed, they instinctively knew how to navigate and sign up.

•	Hierarchical content structure 
-I observed this by making the highest heading the parent and sub headings, by importance, chronologically.
-The code is also appropriately indented.
In CSS file the styles that are global appear at the top, then the sections are as they appear on the nav bar.  So about us is before faq. etc  

•	Responsive design 
This is design that allows a website to adapt well to the users device, so the website maintains an optimal and useable appearance on all screen sizes.
This aspect was the hardest to factor in given the time limit and knowledge and experience lacking.  However, I could not use every conceivable device type, to verify so I used a desktop, laptop, ipad, iphone and 1 andriod mobile (given that there are hundreds of different types)
Instead I set relevant responsive breakpoints, to test and check against.
Tested using Chrome dev tools, how the webpages look on laptop, desktop,  ipad, iphone and an android phone.
Screenshots below:


Reliable transparent interface- The Soap hero is easy to use, read, navigate through the pages.  The Navigation from page to page is easy and the functions work.  It is also visually appealing, and the call-to-action button is clear and tempting enough to motivate the user to act.  

Frictionless conversation- we focused more on reason a positive message of reasons to love natural; and although we stated the problem with the alternative, we did not do a hit job or negative campaign against it.  The message is positive, informative and encouraging.

TESTING
Tests conducted and their output are documented separately in a test.md file in the soap hero repository.
