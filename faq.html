                        <hr>
                        <p> <p>Natural soap, whether stirctly organic or just botanical, is an all-round hero in our opinion.  It looks good because the artisans go above and beyond to preset it well, it smells great, as the soap makers use non-toxic, natural fragrances which have been extracted over a slow process from flowers, roots and stems, and they are intentionally enriched with skin loving natural ingredients which result in a compelling piece of cleansing bar.  Yet, does no harm to the environment nor to the skin.  No trade off!  It wows and delights!</p></p>

                        <h3>Is natural soap really safe, and especially for infants?</h3>
                        <p>Broadly speaking yes!  However, like every profession, the competence levels of the soap maker and their adherance to safty standats and good production procedures, can compromise the end product if there are any complacencies.  Alway ask for qualifiction and test certificates.</p>

                        <h3>When was soap invented? <i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell"></i></h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>2800BC.  There are recordings dating back 5000 years to the Sumer region in Bronze Age Mesopotamia, now southern Iraq.  These texts from that era describe ways of making soap from the resin of fir trees.  Similarly, there are 5000 year-old folk tales from Ghana in west Africa of making soap with banana ash, The African Black soap.</p>

                    <h3>Can I trust soap that is handmade? <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"></i></h3>
                        <p>Natural soap makers prioritize ethical production methods and transparency.  These qualities are of the highest importance to the demographic that favour natural soap, making it safer to the consumer to know fully all the information about the ingredients added and even the particular production method used.  This openness and transparency puts back power in the hands of the consumers, allowing them make informed decisions that align with their personal values.</p>

                        <h3>Why is Natural soap more expensive?<i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i></h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Natural ingredients cost more than synthetic chemicals.  Just imagine the cost of your grocery shopping if you only bought organic; therefore the soap is more expensive to make.  Furthermore, it is made by hand, instead of machines, so a more laborious process, although lovingly undertaken, and usually in small batches.  It has been said that no two bars of the same batch are exactly the same.  Well all this takes more time, money and physical effort than factory made with machine, soaps.  Mass production also uses  cheap inferior ingredients.  The packaging too for Natural soaps are also ,ade by hand.</p>
